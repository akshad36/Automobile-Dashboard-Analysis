Drawn various visualization and insights 

The primary objective of the analysis is to gain insights into the 
sales performance of different car brands across various 
countries, track sales trends over time, and identify patterns and 
relationships in the dataset. This can help in understanding 
customer preferences, optimizing inventory, and improving sales 
strategies.


The dataset includes various columns that provide detailed 
information about car sales, including financial aspects (sale 
price, cost price, discounts), logistical aspects (delivery charges, 
spare parts, labor costs), client details, and vehicle details (make, 
model, color, type). This comprehensive data allows for in-depth 
analysis of sales performance, cost management, and customer 
preferences across different regions and time periods
